# Play Framework and Apache Pekko Upgrade

## Overview

This repository has been upgraded from Play Framework 2.7.2 with Akka 2.5.22 to Play Framework 3.0.5 with Apache Pekko 1.0.2.

## Why This Upgrade

**License Compliance**: Akka changed from Apache 2.0 to Business Source License 1.1, requiring commercial licenses for production use. Apache Pekko maintains Apache 2.0 license.

**Security**: Play 2.7.2 and Akka 2.5.22 no longer receive security updates.

**Modernization**: Access to latest features and performance improvements.

## Technology Stack Changes

- Play Framework: 2.7.2 to 3.0.5
- Actor Framework: Akka 2.5.22 to Apache Pekko 1.0.2
- Scala: 2.12.11 to 2.13.12
- Guice: 3.0 to 5.1.0
- SLF4J: 1.6.1 to 2.0.13
- Logback: 1.2.3 to 1.4.14
- Jackson: 2.13.5 to 2.14.3
- Netty: 4.1.77.Final to 4.1.112.Final

## Key Changes

### Dependencies

All Maven POM files updated with new versions. Play Framework groupId changed from com.typesafe.play to org.playframework. Scala library exclusions added to prevent version conflicts between Scala 2.12 and 2.13.

### Source Code

Akka imports migrated to Pekko across all Java files:
- akka.actor.* to org.apache.pekko.actor.*
- akka.pattern.* to org.apache.pekko.pattern.*
- akka.routing.* to org.apache.pekko.routing.*
- akka.util.* to org.apache.pekko.util.*
- akka.testkit.* to org.apache.pekko.testkit.*

Updated FutureConverters for Scala 2.13:
- scala.compat.java8.FutureConverters to scala.jdk.javaapi.FutureConverters
- toJava() to asJava()

### Configuration

application.conf files updated with Pekko namespaces:
- akka {} to pekko {}
- Actor system configurations migrated
- Serialization bindings updated
- Dispatcher references changed


### Play 3.0 API Updates

Play 3.0 removed the request() method and Http.Context. All controller methods now inject Http.Request as a parameter.

Controller updates:
- HealthController
- NotificationController
- NotificationTemplateController
- LogController
- BaseController helper methods

Routes file updated with request injection for all endpoints.

### Test Framework

Test files updated:
- Replaced JavaTestKit.duration() with java.time.Duration.ofSeconds()
- Resolved Duration class ambiguity between java.time and scala.concurrent
- Fixed import conflicts

### Scala Version Conflicts

Added exclusions to prevent Scala 2.12 transitive dependencies:
- Excluded scala-library and scala-reflect from dependencies where needed
- Explicitly declared scala-library 2.13.12 dependency

## Build Instructions

Build all modules:
```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

Build with test compilation:
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Create distribution package:
```
cd service
mvn play2:dist
```

## Migration Impact

**Business Logic**: No changes to business logic or functionality

**API Compatibility**: Maintained, as Pekko is API-compatible with Akka 2.6

**Code Changes**: Primarily package name updates from akka to pekko

**License**: Now compliant with Apache 2.0 throughout the stack

## Known Issues

**Scala 2.12/2.13 Conflict**: If you encounter NoClassDefFoundError for scala.collection.GenMap, verify dependency tree to ensure no Scala 2.12 artifacts are present. Run mvn dependency:tree and add exclusions for any scala-library or scala-reflect with version 2.12.

**PowerMock Tests**: PowerMock is incompatible with Java 9+ module system. Tests using PowerMock will need to be updated or JVM arguments added.

## Verification Steps

1. Clean compilation successful
2. All modules build without errors
3. Dependency tree verified for no Scala 2.12 conflicts
4. Configuration files validated
5. Routes file compiled successfully
